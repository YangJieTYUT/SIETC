by Xiufang Feng, Jie Yang, Yongfei Wu, Hao Zhang
## Introduction
This repository is the Matlab implementation of "_**Robust Encryption and Compression of Sequential Images Using STP-CS and 2D-EPHM: A Novel Asymmetric Approach**_"
## Requirements
We implemented our experiment on the computer system of Taiyuan University of Technology. The specific configuration is as follows:
i5-6500H CPU, 64bit operating system, 8GB RAM, 512G SSD, and MATLAB R2016b.
## Usage
- Add the project and its subfolders to the Matlab running path
- Run the main.m
## dataset
The used datasets are openly available from https://sipi.usc.edu/database/database.php?volume=sequences
## Note
- The repository is being updated.
